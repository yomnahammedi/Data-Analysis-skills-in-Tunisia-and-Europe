# Data-Analysis-skills-in-Tunisia-and-Europe
This is my first mini-project in data analysis.  

##The purpose of this mini project is: 
1-truly identify the needed skills for an internship/entry level job in the data analysis market. As abeginner in Data Analysis I was faced by tons of articles and videos about which skills are needed and all the contents were contradicting, as if everyone was speaking from their personal experience without an actual objective answer.
2-By identifying the skills needed, I hope this mini-project helps me and others create a valuable roadmap to learning data analysis 
3- During this project I aim to learn and upskill in different analatical tools such as python, sql, github and excel 

##Data sources and Data sets 
I chose to derive my data from networking platforms such as LinkedIn and hiring platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, TunisiaTnaqeeb and Obtioncarriere because I aim to see what skills do Current data analysts interns or junior analysts have. 
I also took my data from reports and curriculums from learning platforms and data analysis course in my university as well as ia used datasets around the subject from 
Kaggle.com
